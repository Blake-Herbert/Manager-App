# Manager App

This repo contains the manager/admin facing side of my time clock application. It is intended to be used by managers to track employee hours, wages, and employee PINs for clocking in and out. Please clone the [Time Clock Backend](https://github.com/Blake-Herbert/Time-Clock-Backend) and [Employee Time Clock](https://github.com/Blake-Herbert/Employee-Time-Clock) repos for full functionality.
